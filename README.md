# Babashka AI Coding Tools

Babashka tasks for running tests via nREPL connections.

## Overview

Provides utilities for connecting to nREPL servers and running tests.
Runs in Babashka, making it fast & easy for Agents to run tests from the command line.

## Features

- Connect to nREPL servers
- Run tests in specified namespaces
- Reload namespaces before running tests
- Capture test output (stdout/stderr)

## Installation

The REPL where your tests will run must have [tools.namespace](https://github.com/clojure/tools.namespace) installed

Add the following dependencies to your bb.edn (check for latest commit)

```clojure
{babashka/nrepl-client {:git/url "https://github.com/babashka/nrepl-client"
                        :git/sha "19fbef2525e47d80b9278c49a545de58f48ee7cf"}
 nextdoc/ai-tools      {:git/url "https://github.com/nextdoc/ai-tools.git"
                        :git/sha "03be7d51b334c83e304eaf578c86403d5f95d133"}}
```

Add this task (from the bb.edn in this project) to your bb.edn

```clojure
{nrepl:test {:requires [[io.nextdoc.tools :as tools]]
             :doc      "Run a test in the JVM using an nrepl connection i.e. fast test runner from cli"
             :task     (System/exit (tools/run-tests-task *command-line-args*))}}
```

Run the task to confirm installation and see the options

```bash
bb nrepl:test
```

### Command Line Options

- `-n, --namespaces`: Comma-separated list of test namespaces to run (required)
- `-d, --directories`: Comma-separated list of directories to scan for changes & reload before running tests (optional)
- `-p, --port-file`: Path to the file containing the nREPL port (default: ".nrepl-port")

## Usage

The task is intended to be used with AI coding agents as a test runner.
Add this text to your agent instructions...

```
Run tests using this command `bb nrepl:test -n <fully qualified test namespace>`

Optionally specify directories to reload: `bb nrepl:test -n <namespace> -d src,test`
```

Ensure the REPL in your project is started.

## Test runner

Run the task with valid options to run your test(s)

The task will return a zero exit code if the tests pass.
The return code is used by most coding agents to determine if a test passed or not.

If standard out or standard error is present this will be echoed to the terminal.
This allows coding agents to see logs and exceptions from test runs.

## Workflows

The Test Runner task is designed for a TDD style development workflow.

Tests can be in their own namespace or it can be useful to create a fiddle namespace and have sample code and a test to
drive that code in the same file.

There are many AI development agents that can be used with this task.
What follows is the setup and workflow for the agents we have tested...

### Aider

Aider is a very precise AI development agent.
Precision means that you manage all the files in its context and which files are readable and writable.
This provides a high level of control but requires more manual work to manage the context.

In your .aider.conf.yaml file you will want...

```yaml
auto-commits: false
watch-files: true
test-cmd: bb nrepl:test -n your.test.namespace
auto-test: true
yes-always: true
```

This will allow you to [add comments](https://aider.chat/docs/usage/watch.html#aider-in-your-ide) in any namespace which Aider will pick up following any instructions and then will
automatically rerun the tests using the test runner task.
It will also automatically add the output from the test runner to its context and will automatically fix any errors it
notices when the test runner returns a non-zero exit code.

The biggest downside of working with this level of automation is that there is no human in the loop interruption unless
Aider iterates until it makes the tests pass.
You can inject yourself back into the loop by using CTRL-C at any time in the terminal.

The upside is this is a very lean and focused automated loop which you can control with a great deal of precision.
The speed of the test runner means that iteration is rapid.

## Alternatives

This tool is designed to provide fast test execution and feedback for coding agents without need for any extra
infrastructure. Just a simple command line task for a coding agent to invoke.

For the next level of sophistication you probably want to look for an MCP server.
There are quite a few MCP servers that allow REPL connections and evaluations.

## Is it safe?

This is a **buyer beware** situation. Any coding agent that can write and evaluate code on your computer has associated
risks.

The responsibility for checking the code being run is on you.

You might think that providing access to a REPL raises the risk of unwanted side effects.
This is partially true but most coding agents can also write bash scripts and pose the same level of danger from running
those scripts.
